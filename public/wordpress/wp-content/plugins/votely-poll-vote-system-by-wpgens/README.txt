== Description ==

**Boost your user engagement!**

Votely is simple opinion system that acts as a poll, which is placed at the end of each post once added during post creation (check screenshots). Its perfect to gain user attention and increase engagement. It should be used for simple opinion questions with Yes/No answers, anything lengthy will decrease engagement, thats why for now you can only add 2 answers. It comes with twitter/facebook share which allows sharing of poll on social networks easily, its also responsive.

Votely is fast, ajax powered, coded with best practice, super light and will not slow down your site.It has one script and one style file that is loaded only on post that has votely activated!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why only 2 answers? =
User engagement for polls is decreasing with each answer, so is trying to keep it simple, buy forcing only 2 possible answers. If there is big demand for more/multiple answers, it will be added.
